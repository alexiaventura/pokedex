## App Overview

### Description

**Pokemon App with various data on pokemon, their location, as well as moves and other items related to games**

### App Evaluation

<!-- Evaluation of your app across the following attributes -->

#### Pokedex (looks up pokemon data)
- **Category:** Entertainment
- **Mobile:** All data is available at your fingertips with the mobile experience in mind, many websites try to be mobile friendly but have too much info to organize
- **Story:** Very clear use case, most players would appreciate this app as a place to get all data on their phon
- **Market:** Pokemon players worldwide
- **Habit:** Every time they need to access information, they would open this app. Knowing pokemon players, that will be very often
- **Scope:** Very challenging, we have a head start thanks to me doing a project on a section of this, but making other sections possible will be a little daunting for our group.

## Build Notes

We needed far more than a week to complete this project. Our schedules are too packed for a project like this to be completed.
