### App Evaluation

#### Pokedex (looks up pokemon data)
- **Category:** Entertainment
- **Mobile:** All data is available at your fingertips with the mobile experience in mind, many websites try to be mobile friendly but have too much info to organize
- **Story:** Very clear use case, most player would appreaciate this app as a place to get all data on their phon
- **Market:** Pokemon players worldwide
- **Habit:** Every time they need to access information, they would open this app. Knowing pokemon players, that will be very often
- **Scope:** Very challenging, we have a head start thanks to me doing a project on a section of this, but making other sections possible will be a little daunting for our group.

#### Multipay (allows users to make one pay and split a bill)
- **Category:** Financial
- **Mobile:** Very mobile, this in not useful in a restaurant setting if it's only available as a website. Better left as an app
- **Story:** May see like a commodity more than a necesity, 
- **Market:** Sort of unique, But not large as many people just pay on their own or bring cash
- **Habit:** Only useful in a restaurant setting
- **Scope:** will need to connect to banks and official payment structures, making it very difficult to create and release.

#### Song Recommendations (Recommends a new song for a user randomly)
- **Category:** Entertainment
- **Mobile:** Good for mobile devices since a lot of people listen to music on their phones, user interface could be more convenient to use on there
- **Story:** Useful for music lovers, could expand to being a social media app focused on discovering new music by chance
- **Market:** Large market because a lot of people listen to music, could be more specific though to anyone who prefers indie music
- **Habit:** Could be addicting if it's a social media app, otherwise more like a party trick kind of app
- **Scope:** Very vague since platforms already do this for you (recommending similar music), would need more time to think of a more unique way to implement this idea
